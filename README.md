# Image-captioning-app
In our project we are using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which first acts as an encoder, for classification of tasks and the last layerâ€™s output is further provided as the input to Long Short-Term memory(LSTM) which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) which acts as a decoder that generates sentences.
The project aims to develop an application to generate captions for the provided  image. This would help in many aspects of life. Image captioning is a part of deep  learning where the machine is trained over a platform with the help of proper  images and caption datasets.

## Motivation
Blindness makes life rather difficult for people who suffer from this health roblem, but the use of technology can help in some day-to-day tasks. We opose a technical remedy for the visually impaired so that they can avigate themselves with their own self without external assistance. Ideology behind this project is to strike an impact on the society so that visually backward beings can equalize their status.
